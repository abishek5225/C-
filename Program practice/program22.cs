/*
Create a class named 'Shape' with a method to print "This is This is shape". Then create
two other classes named 'Rectangle', 'Circle' inheriting the Shape class, both having a
method to print "This is rectangular shape" and "This is circular shape" respectively.
Create a subclass 'Square' of 'Rectangle' having a method to print "Square is a rectangle".
Now call the method of 'Shape' and 'Rectangle' class by the object of 'Square' class.
