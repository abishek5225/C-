Exception Handling in C# is a mechanism to handle errors (unexpected situations) 
that occur during program execution. It allows you to respond to problems gracefully 
instead of crashing the application.

Why Use Exception Handling?
Prevents program crashes.
Provides meaningful error messages.
Allows recovery from errors.

Common Keywords in Exception Handling

try: Code that may throw an exception goes here.
catch: Handles the exception if it occurs.
finally: Code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurs.
throw: Used to throw an exception manually.

Basic Syntax:

try
{
    // Code that might cause an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType ex)
{
    // Code to handle the exception
}
finally
{
    // Code that always runs (optional)
}
