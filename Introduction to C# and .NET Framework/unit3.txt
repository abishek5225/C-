Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:
This unit focuses on the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming 
(OOP) in C#. These principles make it easier to write and maintain large 
programs by organizing code into reusable units.


#                                           class

So what is this class thing?

As you know that C# is an object-oriented programming language.
Everything in C# is associated with classes and objects, along 
with its attributes and methods.For example: in real life, a car 
is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, 
and methods, such as drive and brake.

-- To create a class, use the class keyword:

        class Animal 
        {
          string animal= "DOG";
        }
As you can see here we've created a class named "Animal"
With a String type variable and stored "DOG" data inside the 
variable.


#                        Constructors and Destructors

So what do you mean by a Constructors and Destructors?

Constructor: A special method that is called automatically 
             when you create an object. It helps to initialize 
             properties of the object.


Destructor: A special method that is called when an object is being 
            destroyed (not used often in modern C#).


public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    // Constructor
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    public void Introduce()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hi, I am {Name} and I am {Age} years old.");
    }
}

 --Constructor is called here:

Person person = new Person("Abishek", 21);
person.Introduce();

Hi, I am Abishek and I am 22 years old.


#                   What is reference?

    In C#, when you create an object, the variable that holds it is 
    usually a reference to that object in memory. This means multiple 
    variables can refer to the same object. If you change the object 
    through one variable, the change is visible through other variables 
    that reference the same object.

    Example in Real Life:
    Imagine you have a book in a library. Instead of carrying the book everywhere, 
    you note its location (reference) in the library catalog. With this reference, 
    you can find and use the book whenever needed. The book itself stays in one place, 
    but you can access it through the reference.



#                   this Referance
The this keyword in C# is a special reference that represents the 
current instance of the class. It's used to refer to the instance 
variables, methods, or constructors of the class you're working within.

The this keyword in C# is like a way for an object to refer to itself. 
Imagine every object has a mirror, and when it looks into that mirror, 
it sees itself — that's what this does. It points to the current object 
(the instance of the class) that is being used.


#                    Properties

Properties are like "variables" inside a class, but they are more controlled.
You can set (assign a value) or get (retrieve a value) with properties.
Example in Code:

public class Book
{
    public string Title { get; set; } // Property
    public string Author { get; set; } // Property


Book myBook = new Book();
myBook.Title = "C# Made Simple";
myBook.Author = "Abishek";
Console.WriteLine($"Book: {myBook.Title} by {myBook.Author}");

}


#               Indexers

    An indexer allows an object of a class or struct to be indexed like an array. 
    Instead of using methods to access elements, you can use square brackets ([]) to get or set values in a class.

    For example:
    Imagine you have a class that stores multiple values, like names or numbers. Normally, 
    you’d create methods like GetName() or SetName() to access these values. With indexers, 
    you don’t need those methods! Instead, you can use square brackets ([]), just like you do with arrays.

    Program to make you more clear abot Indexers
    Example 1: Without Indexers

    class NamesCollection
{
    private string[] names = new string[5];

    public string GetName(int index)
    {
        return names[index];
    }

    public void SetName(int index, string value)
    {
        names[index] = value;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        NamesCollection names = new NamesCollection();

        // Using methods to set and get values
        names.SetName(0, "Abishek");
        Console.WriteLine(names.GetName(0)); // Output: Abishek
    }
}

With Indexers:

class NamesCollection
{
    private string[] names = new string[5];

    // Indexer to get and set names
    public string this[int index]
    {
        get { return names[index]; } // Get a name
        set { names[index] = value; } // Set a name
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        NamesCollection names = new NamesCollection();

        // Use the indexer to set values
        names[0] = "Abishek"; // This is like SetName(0, "Abishek")
        names[1] = "Sita";

        // Use the indexer to get values
        Console.WriteLine(names[0]); // Output: Abishek
        Console.WriteLine(names[1]); // Output: Sita
    }
}





#               Static Constructors

A static constructor is used to initialize any static data, or 
to perform a particular action that needs to be performed only 
once. It's called automatically before the first instance is 
created or any static members are referenced. 
A static constructor is called at most once.

public class Settings
{
    public static string AppName { get; set; }

    // Static Constructor
    static Settings()
    {
        AppName = "My Awesome App";
    }
    static void Main(){
        Console.WriteLine(Settings.AppName);
    }
}

--->Static constructors have the following properties:

    ->A static constructor doesn't take access modifiers or have parameters.
    ->A class or struct can only have one static constructor.
    ->Static constructors can't be inherited or overloaded.
    ->A static constructor can't be called directly and is only meant to be called by the common language runtime (CLR).


#                   Finalizers

A finalizer (also known as a destructor) is a special method in C# that is used
 to clean up resources before an object is destroyed. It’s useful when your object 
 holds unmanaged resources, like file handles or database connections, and you need 
 to release them properly.

  Key Points About Finalizers:

->Finalizers cannot be defined in structs. They are only used with classes.

->A class can only have one finalizer.

->Finalizers cannot be inherited or overloaded.

->Finalizers cannot be called. They are invoked automatically.

->A finalizer does not take modifiers or have parameters.

->Finalizers look like constructors but with a tilde ~ before the class name.


For example, the following is a declaration of a finalizer for the Car class.

class Car
{
    ~Car()  // finalizer
    {
        // cleanup statements...
    }
}

When to Use a Finalizer?

A finalizer should be used when your class works with unmanaged resources—things 
that the .NET Garbage Collector cannot handle automatically. 
Examples of unmanaged resources include:

1. File Handles: If your class opens files and doesn’t properly close them, 
                 it can cause problems like locked files.

2. Database Connections: If you open a connection to a database, you need to 
                        make sure it gets closed, even if the program crashes.

3. Network Connections: If your class uses sockets or communicates over the internet, 
                        you must release those resources properly.


Simple Example
Imagine you have a class that works with a file:

public class FileHandler
{
    private System.IO.FileStream fileStream;

    public FileHandler(string filePath)
    {
        fileStream = new System.IO.FileStream(filePath, System.IO.FileMode.OpenOrCreate);
    }

    // Finalizer ensures the file is closed
    ~FileHandler()
    {
        fileStream?.Close(); // Close the file if not already closed
        Console.WriteLine("Finalizer called: File closed.");
    }
}

If someone forgets to close the file manually, the finalizer ensures it gets closed when the object is destroyed.






#                        Dynamic Binding:

In C# dynamic is a keyword that is used to make a property or a method dynamic. 
When we make dynamic type, compilerdoes not check it at compile-time. Compiler 
checks it only at run time. The purpose of using dynamic binding is to avoid 
compile time checking of the code.



#                           Operator Overloading


Object-oriented programming concepts such as Polymorphism, which means one name 
having different forms and implementations. It allows the variables or the object 
to take different kinds of forms while executing the code. It is mainly used when 
you want the method property not to be similar to the given arguments, rather want 
a different order of execution when one name can be used with different types of 
execution methods and properties. This can be achieved in a program with different 
types of parameters and their count. 

Key Points About Operator Overloading:-


Static Method:
Operator overloading methods must be static.

Custom Type:
At least one operand must be of the class or struct type where the operator is being overloaded.

Keyword operator:
You use the operator keyword to define an overloaded operator.

program:

class Point
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }

    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }

    // Overloading the + operator
    public static Point operator +(Point p1, Point p2)
    {
        return new Point(p1.X + p2.X, p1.Y + p2.Y);
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"({X}, {Y})";
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Point p1 = new Point(2, 3);
        Point p2 = new Point(4, 5);

        Point result = p1 + p2; // Using the overloaded + operator
        Console.WriteLine(result); // Output: (6, 8)
    }
}


#                   Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
where one class (called the derived or child class) can acquire the properties 
and methods of another class (called the base or parent class). This allows code 
reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

Why Use Inheritance?
Code Reuse:
Common functionality can be written once in a base class and reused by derived classes.

Extensibility:
You can add new features to a derived class without modifying the base class.

Polymorphism:
Inheritance enables polymorphism, where a derived class can override methods of the base class to provide specialized behavior.


Syntax of Inheritance in C# :-
In C#, you use the : symbol to define inheritance.

class BaseClass
{
    // Members of the base class
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    // Members of the derived class
}


1. Single Inheritance
In single inheritance, a class inherits from one base class. 
This is the simplest form of inheritance.

Example:

class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.Eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        dog.Bark(); // Defined in Dog
    }
}

2. Multilevel Inheritance
In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a derived class, creating a chain of inheritance.

Example:
class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking.");
    }
}

class Puppy : Dog
{
    public void Weep()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Puppy is weeping.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Puppy puppy = new Puppy();
        puppy.Eat();  // From Animal
        puppy.Bark(); // From Dog
        puppy.Weep(); // From Puppy
    }
}

3. Hierarchical Inheritance
In hierarchical inheritance, multiple classes inherit from a single base class.

Example:

class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking.");
    }
}

class Cat : Animal
{
    public void Meow()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cat is meowing.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        Cat cat = new Cat();

        dog.Eat();  // From Animal
        dog.Bark(); // Defined in Dog

        cat.Eat();  // From Animal
        cat.Meow(); // Defined in Cat
    }
}

4. Multiple Inheritance (Not Supported Directly in C#)
C# does not support multiple inheritance (a class inheriting from multiple base classes) 
to avoid ambiguity. However, it can be achieved using interfaces.

interface IFlyable
{
    void Fly();
}

interface ISwimmable
{
    void Swim();
}

class Bird : IFlyable, ISwimmable
{
    public void Fly()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bird is flying.");
    }

    public void Swim()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bird is swimming.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Bird bird = new Bird();
        bird.Fly();
        bird.Swim();
    }
}

#                        Abstract Classes and Methods

Abstract Class:

An abstract class is a special type of class that cannot be 
instantiated(You cannot create an object of an abstract class. 
It is meant to be inherited by other classes.) directly. 
It serves as a blueprint for derived classes and often contains 
one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared without implementation.


Abstract Methods:

1.  No Implementation in the Base Class:
    An abstract method is declared but not implemented in the abstract class.

2.  Must Be Overridden:
    Derived classes must override all abstract methods of the base class


Example: Abstract Class and Methods:

// Abstract Class
abstract class Shape
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    // Abstract Method
    public abstract double CalculateArea();

    // Concrete Method
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Shape: {Name}");
    }
}

// Derived Class: Circle
class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public Circle(double radius)
    {
        Name = "Circle";
        Radius = radius;
    }

    // Overriding the abstract method
    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}

// Derived Class: Rectangle
class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    public Rectangle(double width, double height)
    {
        Name = "Rectangle";
        Width = width;
        Height = height;
    }

    // Overriding the abstract method
    public override double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Width * Height;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Shape circle = new Circle(5);
        circle.Display();
        Console.WriteLine($"Area: {circle.CalculateArea()}");

        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);
        rectangle.Display();
        Console.WriteLine($"Area: {rectangle.CalculateArea()}");
    }
}



#                      Base Keyword

The base keyword in C# is used to access members of the base class (parent class) 
from within a derived class (child class). It serves as a bridge to interact with 
the base class's methods, properties, constructors, or fields.

Accessing Base Class Members
In this example, the base keyword is used to call the base class method inside an overridden method.

class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        base.Speak(); // Call the base class's Speak method
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.Speak();
    }
}


Calling the Base Class Constructor
In this example, the base keyword is used to call a parameterized constructor of the base class.

class Animal
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public Animal(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
        Console.WriteLine($"Animal constructor called. Name: {Name}");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public Dog(string name) : base(name) // Call base class constructor
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog constructor called.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
    }
}



#                   Overloading

Overloading allows you to define multiple methods or operators with the same name in the 
same class, but with different parameters. This improves code readability and flexibility.

For better understanding, Overloading can be defined as same person(methods) having different behavior(parameters).

class Calculator
{
    // Add two integers
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Add three integers
    public int Add(int a, int b, int c)
    {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Add two doubles
    public double Add(double a, double b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        Console.WriteLine(calc.Add(2, 3));          
        Console.WriteLine(calc.Add(2, 3, 4));  
        Console.WriteLine(calc.Add(2.5, 3.7));  
    }
}


#                       Object types

In C#, object is the most general type. It is the base type from which all other types (such as int, string, bool, and even custom types) are derived. 
This means that every single type in C# can be assigned to an object variable.

An object can hold any kind of data, whether it is a number, a string, or even a custom class object. This makes it very flexible.

When you store a value type (like int or float) into an object, it’s called boxing. When you retrieve that value, it’s called unboxing.

The object class provides some useful methods that all types have, such as ToString(), Equals(), and GetType().


Example: Storing Different Types in object

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        object obj1 = 5;          
        object obj2 = "Hello";     
        object obj3 = new DateTime(2024, 12, 9);

        Console.WriteLine(obj1); 
        Console.WriteLine(obj2);  
        Console.WriteLine(obj3);  
    }
}

note: Here, all types (like int, string, and DateTime) are assigned to object variables. This is possible because all types in C# derive from object.


->  Boxing and Unboxing
    Boxing is the process of converting a value type (like int) into an object (reference type).

    int number = 10;
    object obj = number;  // Boxing: Converting int to object

->  Unboxing is the process of converting an object back to a value type.

    object obj = 10;  // Boxing
    int number = (int)obj;  // Unboxing: Converting object back to int

Important Methods in object:

->  ToString():
    Converts the object to a string representation.
    Example:

    object obj = 123;
    Console.WriteLine(obj.ToString());  // Output: 123

->  Equals():
    Compares two objects for equality.
    Example:

    object obj1 = 5;
    object obj2 = 5;
    Console.WriteLine(obj1.Equals(obj2));  // Output: True

->  GetType():
    Returns the type of the object.
    Example:

    object obj = 10;
    Console.WriteLine(obj.GetType());  // Output: System.Int32

->  GetHashCode():
    Returns a unique identifier (hash code) for the object, useful in collections.
    Example:

    object obj = "Hello";
    Console.WriteLine(obj.GetHashCode());  // Output: hash code of the string


When to Use object?

    When you don't know the exact type you will be working with, or when you want to write 
    general code that can handle multiple types of data.

    When working with collections or structures that need to handle different types of data 
    (e.g., ArrayList or older collections in C#).

    When dealing with data that might change types at runtime.



#                       struct

    In C#, a struct is a data type that can hold data, similar to a class, but there are some important differences. 
    A struct is a value type, which means it stores its data directly. When you assign a struct to a new variable, 
    the data is copied rather than referenced.

Key Points About Structs

1.  Structs are value types, meaning that when you assign a struct to a new variable, a copy of the data is made. 
    This is different from classes, which are reference types (where variables hold references to the same object in memory).

2.  A struct is defined using the struct keyword. Unlike classes, structs cannot inherit from other structs or classes, 
    and they cannot be used as a base type for other types.

3.  Structs are typically more memory-efficient than classes because they do not require heap memory (they are allocated on the stack).

4.  Structs do not have a default constructor (i.e., a constructor with no parameters) like classes. However, they do have an implicit 
    default constructor that initializes all fields to their default values.


    Example of Struct:

struct Demo{
    public int X;
    public int Y;

    //constructor to initialize struct
    public Demo(int x, int y){
        X=x;
        Y=y;
    }

    public void Display(){
        Console.WriteLine($"Point ({X}, {Y})");
    }
}
class Program{
    static void Main(){
        //Creating instance of Demo struct
        Demo obj1 = new obj(10,20);
        obj1.Display(); // output: Point (10,20)

        Demo obj2 = obj1;
        obj2.X = 15;    //modified obj2
        obj2.Display(); //output: Point (15,20)

         obj1.Display(); // output: Point (10,20)        
    }
}

code Highlights:

 We created a Demo struct with X and Y fields, and a 
 constructor to set those values.

 When we assigned obj1 to obj2, we made a copy of obj1's data, 
 so changing obj2.X doesn’t affect obj1.X. This is because structs are value types.
        


#                       Access Modifiers

Access modifiers in C# define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, properties, fields, 
and other members. They control how and where you can use these members within your code.
C# has several access modifiers that determine the scope of access to a class or its members.
They are:-

public:

Accessible from anywhere (inside and outside the class or assembly).
Used when you want a class or member to be fully accessible from other classes, even from other projects.

private:

Accessible only within the same class.
Use private for data members or methods that should not be exposed to the outside world. It helps to implement encapsulation.

protected:

Accessible within the same class and derived classes (i.e., subclasses).
Use protected for members that should be visible to derived classes but hidden from outside.



#                       interfaces

An interface in C# is like a contract that defines a set of methods, properties, or events that a class must implement. However, 
unlike classes, interfaces do not contain any implementation for these methods—just their signatures. This means that an interface 
specifies what actions should be done, but not how to do them.

Syntax of an Interface
To declare an interface, use the interface keyword:

public interface IAnimal
{
    void Speak();  // no body
    void Eat();    // no body
}

Implementing an Interface in a Class

public class Dog : IAnimal
{
    // Implementing Speak method
    public void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof! Woof!");
    }

    // Implementing Eat method
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog is eating.");
    }
}

public class Cat : IAnimal
{
    // Implementing Speak method
    public void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Meow!");
    }

    // Implementing Eat method
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The cat is eating.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IAnimal myDog = new Dog();   // Create a Dog object
        IAnimal myCat = new Cat();   // Create a Cat object

        myDog.Speak();  // Output: Woof! Woof!
        myDog.Eat();    // Output: The dog is eating.

        myCat.Speak();  // Output: Meow!
        myCat.Eat();    // Output: The cat is eating.
    }
}


 Polymorphism with Interfaces

 public interface IAnimal
{
    void Speak();
}

public class Dog : IAnimal
{
    public void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
    }
}

public class Cat : IAnimal
{
    public void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Meow!");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create an array of IAnimal
        IAnimal[] animals = { new Dog(), new Cat() };

        // Loop through the array and call Speak on each object
        foreach (IAnimal animal in animals)
        {
            animal.Speak();  // Output: Woof! Meow!
        }
    }
}

Both Dog and Cat implement the IAnimal interface. You can store them in an array of IAnimal and 
call the Speak() method on each one, despite them being different types.


#                           Enums

An enum (short for enumeration) is a way to define a set of named values that represent a collection of related constants. 
It makes your code more readable and meaningful by replacing simple numbers or strings with descriptive names.
For example, instead of using numbers like 1, 2, or 3 to represent days of the week, you can use an enum with names like 
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. This makes the code easier to understand and reduces mistakes.

Example:

using System;

public enum Day
{
    Sunday = 1,
    Monday = 2,
    Tuesday = 3,
    Wednesday = 4,
    Thursday = 5,
    Friday = 6,
    Saturday = 7
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Day today = Day.Monday;  // Assigning an enum value

        if (today == Day.Monday)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("It's Monday!");
        }
    }
}

Traffic light Example:
public enum TrafficLight
{
    Red = 1,
    Yellow = 2,
    Green = 3
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        TrafficLight light = TrafficLight.Red;

        switch (light)
        {
            case TrafficLight.Red:
                Console.WriteLine("Stop");
                break;
            case TrafficLight.Yellow:
                Console.WriteLine("Caution");
                break;
            case TrafficLight.Green:
                Console.WriteLine("Go");
                break;
        }
    }
}
