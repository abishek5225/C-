A Lambda Expression in C# is a concise way to represent a method (or function) using a shorter syntax. 
It is particularly used with delegates, LINQ, and functional programming.

Why Use Lambda Expressions?
Makes code cleaner and avoids writing separate methods.
You donâ€™t need to define a method name.
Especially useful with small, simple operations.

Syntax of Lambda Expressions:

(parameters) => expression

parameters: Input values to the function.
=>: "Goes to" operator, separates parameters from the function body.
expression: The logic or statement.
